# SQL - Business Case
### SQL - Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

**Introduction** <br />
Rockbuster Stealth LLC i s a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use i ts existing movie l icenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.<br />
<br />
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business i ntelligence (BI)
department to help with the l aunch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to l oad all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
<br />
<br />
**Key Questions and Objectives**<br />
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d l ike to answer:<br />
<br />
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?<br />
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?<br />
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?<br />
● Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?<br />
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?<br />
